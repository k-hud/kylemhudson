🎉 You made it! 🍾

Thanks for checking out my profile. Still WIP, as all things are.

In the meantime, a bit about me:

20 years as a Progam Manager and Technical Project Manager, I'm diving into Full-stack Development currently. I'm exploring React, Next, Nuxt, and Gatsby. I enjoy learning the landscape before diving deeper into frameworks. 

Here are a few sites I recently developed and launched (with the help of amazing team members): 

- https://layerframe.co
- https://worlddesignchamp.com
- https://summergamefest.com
- https://blanchardwalsh.com
